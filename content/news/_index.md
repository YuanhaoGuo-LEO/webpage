+ Our previous work "The endoplasmic reticulum junction serves as a platform for lysosome-endosome interaction through their 'stop-and-go' motion switching" has been accepted by the journal "Science Advances". The study establishes ER junctions as central to coordinating organelle dynamics and spatial distribution in the cytoplasm.
